# **Sewage Treatment Results - Data Visualization**

## **Overview**
This repository contains visualizations that analyze and compare the physicochemical characteristics of sewage wastewater before and after treatment. These visualizations provide insights into treatment efficacy and control behavior.

## **Visualizations**

### 1. Change in Physicochemical Characteristics
- **Sewage Wastewater - After Treatment**  
  ![After Treatment]([visualizations/change_physicochemical_after_treatment.png](https://github.com/mayur-de/Data_Visualization/blob/9366f1bf2c97bbfff8d8e6e93dd3f60442b04dd6/1.%20Visualizations%20-%20Sewage%20Treatment%20Results/plots/Change%20in%20Physicochemical%20Characteristics%20in%20Sewage%20Wastewater%20-%20After%20Treatment.png))
  
- **Sewage Wastewater - Control**

### 2. Element Composition
- **Before and After Treatment**
