# **Sewage Treatment Results - Data Visualization**

## **Overview**
This repository contains visualizations that analyze and compare the physicochemical characteristics of sewage wastewater before and after treatment. These visualizations provide insights into treatment efficacy and control behavior.

## **Visualizations**

### 1. Change in Physicochemical Characteristics
- **Sewage Wastewater - After Treatment**  
  ![After Treatment](visualizations/change_physicochemical_after_treatment.png)
  
- **Sewage Wastewater - Control**  
  ![Control](visualizations/change_physicochemical_control.png)

### 2. Element Composition
- **Before and After Treatment**

### 3. Change Comparison (Treatment vs. Control)
- **Error Plot**

### 4. Element Concentrations
- **Normalized**
